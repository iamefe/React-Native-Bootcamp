**What is JSX?**

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly within your JavaScript code.

**Rendering Elements**
Rendering elements is how you display content on the screen. In React Native, elements can be as simple as displaying a piece of text or more complex components composed of multiple elements.

**Embedding Expressions in JSX**

JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}`. This can be useful for dynamically displaying values or running simple calculations directly in your JSX.

**4: JSX Attributes and Styling**

Just like HTML, JSX allows you to pass attributes to components. These attributes can include styles, IDs, and other properties. In React Native, styles are applied using the `style` attribute, which accepts an object or an array of objects.

**5: Conditional Rendering in JSX**

Sometimes, you need to render different elements based on certain conditions. JSX makes this straightforward by allowing you to use conditional expressions.

# Typescript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It allows you to write JavaScript code with additional type annotations, which can help catch errors and provide better tooling support during development.

Overall, TypeScript helps improve the maintainability and scalability of JavaScript projects by providing static typing and advanced tooling features. It is widely used in the React ecosystem, as it enhances the development experience and helps catch potential bugs early on.
